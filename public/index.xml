      <description>A problem with OPRA requests directed to Lakewood Township (Ocean County) has been resolved by officials from the township clerk&amp;rsquo;s office, according to an email received by an OPRAmachine user when they reported the problem to Lakewood.
Requests delivered via OPRAmachine sent to Lakewood inadvertently got caught up in the township&amp;rsquo;s spam filter, preventing any of the requests from getting a response from the clerk&amp;rsquo;s office.</description>

      <description>Individuals who are not residents of New Jersey can file legally valid OPRA requests, a state appellate court ruled.
The court ruling was issued by the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court in an OPRA lawsuit brought by open government activist Harry Scheeler, who formerly lived in Atlantic County before moving out of state.
This is good news for our international and out-of-state users of OPRAmachine, who have made use of our platform to obtain public information from New Jersey state and local government agencies.</description>

      <description>Patrick Duff, an OPRAmachine user recently spoke with us to highlight how he is using our platform to conduct public records research regarding the historical significance of South Jersey properties tied to the late civil rights activist Martin Luther King. He also informed us about how one of his public records requests led to a lawsuit against a city government in state Superior Court.
Our conversation centered on the Open Public Records Act (OPRA), transparency &amp;amp; open government issues centered on my work with public records and how the three of us have made use of my OPRAmachine platform.</description>

      <description>Recently, multiple users have brought it to our attention that they have been receiving spam links to viruses or questionable websites in response to their OPRA requests.
Today, we have taken action to combat the recent rise in spam that has been impacting our users and cluttering request pages. OPRAmachine has increased our capabilities for dealing with spam, and going forward, spam messages that are flagged by our system will be held back before going out to users and being published to request pages.</description>

      <description>Today marks four months since OPRAmachine was officially launched and made accessible to the general public. Since then, it has been breaking down barriers for access to public information in New Jersey and helping to educate the public about OPRA. Our October 24th, 2017 the launch came after several months worth of technical preparation and trial &amp;amp; error as we learned to work with the open source Alavetelisoftware that powers our backend server as well as the technical challenges of managing the various components of the web service.</description>

      <description>Some requests filed by users of OPRAmachine have resulted in litigation against public agencies for their denial of requests. All of these lawsuits have been filed after requests were originally sent out through our platform. Here are some notable cases of interest:
Rozzi v. Office of the Attorney General We have encountered heavy resistance from the state attorney general&amp;rsquo;s office, as the office has refused to provide emailed responses to OPRA requests submitted by our system.</description>

      <description>ATLANTIC COUNTY &amp;#8211; One local news website editor is using OPRAmachine&amp;#8217;s ability to obtain public records to write about sexual harassment claims that were settled by county officials, reporting details that were previously unknown to the public with the help of our system.
This weekend local news site Atlantic County News published an article detailing how that site&amp;#8217;s editor made use of OPRAmachine in order to obtain records regarding several recent out-of-court sexual harassment settlements that involved allegations made against county officials.</description>

      <description>Some requests have been having delivery issues, currently to at least one municipality and one county. The purpose of this blog post is to provide guidance to both members of public sector IT departments / records custodians and the requestors that use OPRAmachine to request information. Are you a records custodian or government official? Please pass this post along to your IT department. Inevitably, as OPRAmachine users make use of the site&amp;#8217;s capabilities to send requests to more towns, some firewalls may inadvertently prevent our emails from getting delivered.</description>

      <description>As of today we are proud to announce that OPRAmachine now reaches every municipality in every county of the State of New Jersey. We now have every municipal government added to our database. This is certainly a milestone for OPRAmachine, but our work is far from over. We still need help adding municipal utilities authorities and various county government agencies.

As it stands now, OPRAmachine will be launching in beta with support for all 33 municipalities, MUAs, school boards and housing authorities for Ocean County. It is the goal of the development team to expand on a county-by-county basis throughout New Jersey in order to bring this powerful tool to more citizens following our launch in Ocean County.</description>

OPRAmachine is based on the open-source Alaveteli freedom of information platform, and is the first deployment of the platform to focus on state &amp;amp; local freedom of information requests.
This website is the official blog of the project. We will periodically update this blog with information about the project and other items of interest.</description>
