[OPRAmachine](https://opramachine.com/) is a first of its kind statewide freedom of information portal that helps people obtain public records from New Jersey state and local government agencies.

OPRAmachine is based on the open-source [Alaveteli](http://alaveteli.org) freedom of information platform, and is the first deployment of the platform to focus on state & local freedom of information requests.

This website is the official blog of the project. We will periodically update this blog with information about the project and other items of interest.
