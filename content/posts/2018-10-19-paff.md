## New Jersey government transparency pioneer John Paff has joined in our fight to hold Monmouth County accountable for dodging legally valid public records requests, filing a certification in our case this week.

Paff, the executive director of Libertarians for Transparent Government, filed a certification supporting OPRAmachine's legal position.

Monmouth County also failed to properly redact information that it provided to Mr. Paff in response to one of his own OPRA requests, that he sent directly to the county and not via OPRAmachine.

While Paff, who is one of the leading advocates for government transparency in New Jersey, doesn't have a direct interest in the ourcome of our case he voiced support for OPRAmachine in our case against the county.

"I do do feel it is important that government agencies be required to fulfill their obligations under OPRA when public agencies receive OPRA requests from individuals who utilize OPRAmachine or any similar website," he said in a certification filed with the court.
