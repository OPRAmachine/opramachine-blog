Recently, multiple users have brought it to our attention that they have been receiving spam links
to viruses or questionable websites in response to their OPRA requests.

Today, we have taken action to combat the recent rise in spam that has been impacting our users and cluttering request pages.
OPRAmachine has increased our capabilities for dealing with spam, and going forward, spam messages
that are flagged by our system will be held back before going out to users and being published to request pages.

We would like to thank all of the users who reported spam responses to us, and encourage all concerned to report
potential spam or phishing attempts to the site administration so that swift action can be taken.
