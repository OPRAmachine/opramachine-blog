Thanks to the diligent efforts of OPRAmachine administrator Jeff Epstein, we've added numerous
additional county governments to our database of government agencies today.

The additional county governments added today that are now ready to receive requests via OPRAmachine include:

[Bergen County](https://opramachine.com/body/bergen_county)

[Essex County](https://opramachine.com/body/essex_county)

[Cumberland County](https://opramachine.com/body/cumberland_county)

[Morris County](https://opramachine.com/body/morris_county)

[Warren County](https://opramachine.com/body/warren_county)

[Sussex County](https://opramachine.com/body/sussex_county)

[Salem County](https://opramachine.com/body/salem_county)

Click on any of the above links to start a new OPRA request or follow requests and responses from these counties.

As always, we are always looking to expand our database of state and local government agencies covered by OPRAmachine. We invite
members of the public to [submit new public agencies](https://opramachine.com/change_request/new) that are not covered by our site so that
we may have as complete as possible database of government agencies subject to OPRA in New Jersey.
