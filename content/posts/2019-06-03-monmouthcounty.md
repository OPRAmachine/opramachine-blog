### OPRAmachine founder Gavin Rozzi spoke at the May 30th, 2019 meeting of the Monmouth County Board of Chosen Freeholders.

Rozzi's remarks were made in response to Assignment Judge Lisa P. Thornton's May 24th ruling in favor of OPRAmachine and its users. The county attempted to deny all requests submitted via our website after one of their employees failed to redact information, despite our attempts to work with the county and rectify their mistake.
