OPRAmachine is proud to announce that our service is now available as a desktop application starting immediately.

Our new desktop application provides the same great functionality our users have come to expect on the main OPRAmachine website, but in a new convenient form factor. Depending on the feedback we receive from the community, we may add additional functionality to this app at a later date, so if you're serious about managing all of your public records requests with OPRAmachine, our app will be something you won't want to miss.

Follow the links below to download the app for your computer. Mac users need to drag OPRAmachine to the Applications folder, whereas Windows users may run the installer.
