#### You can use OPRAmachine to easily receive email alerts for specific towns and government agencies as they receive and respond to requests for public records made using our website.

Even if you don&#8217;t use the site to make your own public records requests, you can become informed about the activities of New Jersey state and local government with OPRAmachine email alerts tailored specifically to the towns and requests you&#8217;d like to follow.

Here are some examples of how you can make use of our tracking capabilities:
