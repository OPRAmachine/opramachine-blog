On June 29th we recorded a webcast highlighting how developers can make use of the [OPRAmachine API](https://docs.opramachine.com/site-administration/api-for-developers/) in order to integrate our extensive data about New Jersey public records into their next web project. 

Our [JSON REST](https://opramachine.com/feed/search/%20(latest_status:successful%20OR%20latest_status:partially_successful).json) and [RSS](https://opramachine.com/feed/search/%20(variety:sent%20OR%20variety:followup_sent%20OR%20variety:response%20OR%20variety:comment)) API endpoints make getting data about public bodies & OPRA requests from around the state, and we can't wait to see what the data journalism and developer communites are able to create with our data.
