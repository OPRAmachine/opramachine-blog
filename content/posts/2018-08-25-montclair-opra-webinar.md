We recently hosted a webinar at the Montclair University Center for Cooperative Media. We discussed
tips and tricks for using OPRAmachine, how the site has served as a public records research tool and
platform, along with some of the challenges and interesting use cases for the site.

The webinar was attended by both journalists and other individuals interested in making use of the advanced public records research capabilities provided by our platform.

Thank you to the folks at the Center who helped put all of this together, and thank you to our attendees who asked insightful questions!
