We are pleased to announce that every county board of elections has been added to OPRAmachine as of today. This has been made possible by one of our users who took the time to compile all of the contact information for the boards of elections that we were missing. We are very grateful for the user's efforts.

With election season recently behind us, we are sure that many of our users are interested in researching local elections, so this addition to the site will sure to be of use.

Send a request to your local board of elections [here.](https://opramachine.com/body/list/all?utf8=%E2%9C%93&public_body_query=Board+of+Elections&commit=Search)
