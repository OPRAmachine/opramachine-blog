#### Today marks four months since OPRAmachine was officially launched and made accessible to the general public. Since then, it has been breaking down barriers for access to public information in New Jersey and helping to educate the public about OPRA.

Our October 24th, 2017 launch came after months worth of technical preparation and trial & error as we learned to work with the
open source [Alaveteli](http://alaveteli.org) software that powers our backend server as well as the technical challenges of
working with the Ruby on Rails web framework.

## By the numbers
Since late October, we have seen:

**1249** OPRA requests submitted to public bodies.

**766** public authorities added to our database.



## How we are making an impact

The impact of OPRAmachine has been seen on several fronts.

**Law Firms** are using OPRAmachine to make requests for documents and information that supplements discovery materials for their cases. Some attorneys are using the site to study specific types of requests in order to be more familiar with how OPRA is being
implemented. Paralegals have similarly been

**Private Investigators** are using OPRAmachine to further their investigations through the use of public records.

**Public Officials** have been making use of our platform to research responses to requests from neighboring counties / municipalities and jurisdictions

**Journalists** have used the public records obtained via OPRAmachine to add authoritative information to their stories.

**Concerned Citizens** are using OPRAmachine to obtain records about local government & law enforcement issues. In some cases, individuals have registered on the site solely to receive notifications about the status of certain requests filed by other users rather than filing new requests of their own.


## The challenges we have faced

Email deliverability has been the biggest challenge that we have been facing in administering OPRAmachine. Despite our use of
industry standard best practices, such as DKIM and SPF, there are still a certain few governments whose email servers continue
to prevent requests from getting through. This has been frustrating to affected users and the site administration, as some
governments have been more willing to work with us than others to resolve these types of issues.

For example, [Jackson Township](https://opramachine.com/body/jackson_township) was originally receiving and responding to requests without issue, however since early 2018 their email server has been rejecting incoming messages from OPRAmachine.

We are thankful to the local government officials that have worked with us to resolve the issues, and remain ready and willing to
work cooperatively when the opportunity presents itself.


## The future

Going forward, in the next year we hope to continue the momentum that OPRAmachine has had since its launch. We intend to introduce
new features and services intended for the professional users of OPRAmachine, as well as working to address some of the current shortcomings.

Despite the challenges we have faced in implementing this project, we believe that OPRAmachine has significantly increased transparency at all levels of New Jersey government - something we can all be happy about.
