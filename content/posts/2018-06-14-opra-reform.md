The New Jersey State Senate Government, Wagering, Tourism & Historic Preservation Commmittee is expected to take action on the OPRA and OPMA reform bills this Thursday, June 14th, 2018. 

The OPRA reform measure under consideration will, among other things, expand attorney fee awards for prevailing OPRA litigants as well as ensuring that subcommitees of governing bodies are subject to more stringent transparency &
disclosure requirements under the law.

The OPRAmachine team supports expanding the scope of OPRA as well as attorney fee awards, as we believe both measures hold
value in ensuring that OPRA can be an effective oversight tool for state and local government.

We therefore encourage our users to email the legislators on the committe to express their support for expanding the public's right of access as well as the ability of the public to bring litigation when public agencies fail to comply with the law.
