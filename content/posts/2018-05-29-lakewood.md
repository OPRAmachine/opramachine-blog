A problem with OPRA requests directed to Lakewood Township (Ocean County) has been resolved by officials from the township clerk's office, according to an email
received by an OPRAmachine user when they reported the problem to Lakewood.

Requests delivered via OPRAmachine sent to Lakewood inadvertently got caught up in the township's spam filter,
preventing any of the requests from getting a response from the clerk's office.
