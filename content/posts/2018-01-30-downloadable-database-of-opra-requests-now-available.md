#### We are making available a downloadable database of all OPRA requests filed through OPRAmachine for analysis and research purposes.

The database will include an index of all OPRA requests filed through OPRAmachine, as well as the current state of each request. We hope this database will be a valuable research tool for those studying OPRA and state & local government in New Jersey.

The database can be obtained in SQLite or CSV format, in addition to being able to be accessed over the morph.io API.

Note: These archives are not updated in real-time, and will be periodically updated. The latest version [will always be available at this link.][1]
