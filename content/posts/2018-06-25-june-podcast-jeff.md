The thousand-dollar email metadata. Pushback from problematic government agencies. Technical challenges of running a statewide freedom of information portal and cutting-edge case law. These are just a few of the topics we address in the latest OPRAmachine podcast interview.

On June 21st, I had the pleasure of joining Jeff Epstein of [Citizens' Media TV](http://citizensmedia.tv/) for a brief interview addressing some recent developments with OPRAmachine and interesting requests and responses generated in the course of its operation. Jeff currently also serves as one our volunteer administrators and has invested time in helping expand our database of government agencies and issues that come up in the course of running the site.
